<body>
This package contains the code to mine the game of life with multiple threads.<br/>

Design options:
<ol>
    <li>Single Responsibility components with job queue.<br/>
        To reduce the system requirements the job queue will be entirely in memory.<br/>

       Threads:
        <ul>
            <li>ThreadManager<ul><li>GameRunner [miner]</li></ul></li>
            <li>ThreadManager<ul><li>ResultFilter</li></li></ul>
        </ul>


        <div>The Managers are chained together to create a pipeline without the need for saving jobs into a database.
        </div>

        <div>The downside to this design is that running the game is quick. Filtering out all the results we don't want, duplicates, non looping states, etc takes the most
        amount of time.</div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Multi pipeline threads.<br/>
        Each thread is responsible for delivering one piece of input from start to finish.
    </li>
</ul>
