### Term Dictionary

A simple dictionary of terms. The dictionary exists as a tree map where each node in the tree is a word from the input string. This itself isn't very interesting and just using a HashMap would be easier. The power comes from being able to take a string of tokens and use the dictionary to find the longest match.
